# USB-Sim
My favorite video game. I spent twenty years meticulously crafting this video game to represent all of those individuals out there who don't understand how to insert a USB-A into its respective port. This game captures that feeling: the feeling of incredible stupidity when the port denies you access. My hope is that this game teaches you to relate.
